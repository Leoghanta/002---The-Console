        <h1>The Console</h1>
        <p>Workshop 1 is all about getting you started with the console. We will be looking at 
            the Developer Tools and understanding how to look at the code behind web pages. We will look 
            at the back end console and using JavaScript code to make things happen.

            <h2>Git Hub</h2>
            <p>Before we get started, all of your course notes are available for you to download as a 
               web page using Git Hub.  Git Hub is a repository that allows online access, multi-user 
               support, version control, basically everything that you need for a software development 
               business. Git Hub has a free version, and also a student version. It is recommended you use 
               your personal e-mail address to sign up to Git Hub so your repositories will stay with you long 
               after your college account has been shut down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first URL for this repository is <a href="https://github.com/Leoghanta/002---The-Console" target="_blank">https://github.com/Leoghanta/002---The-Console</a> and you have 
                a couple of options to grab this repository.
            </p>
            <p>The first way is to go to the web address and select Download As Zip and this will download 
                all the files in this project. Extract the Zip file to a folder in your OneDrive and then 
                open your VSCode to this folder. 
                <div class="img-caption-container">
                    <img width="100%" src="images/downloadaszip.png" alt="Image of GitHub to download as zip">
                    <figcaption>Download As Zip</figcaption>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The other way is to use VSCode directly to clone a repository. This will ask you where you 
                wish to save locally and you can create a folder on your OneDrive.  
                <div class="img-caption-container">
                    <img width="100%" src="images/cloneRepository.png" alt="Image of Cloning a repository in VSCode">
                    <figcaption>Cloning a repository on VSCode</figcaption>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have your own Git Hub account (I advise you do), it will take some practice to 
                push and pull your own repositories. Here is a short video for you that explains how to
                create repositories using VSCode.

            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Web. If you are viewing this as a website, either in a live server, or as 
               as file, you are now ready to code JavaScript. Let's introduce you to the Developer Tools. All browsers 
               have a developer tools options and you can normally get to it through the menu system. F12 also brings up 
               developer options.  The video attach will walk through what the devleoper tools are for and how they can 
               help building and debugging your web sites.

                In this workshop, we'll use the console as this is where a lot of the background communication appears and we 
                can add javascript directly into the console.
            </p>
        </div>  

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Console.log()</h2>
            <p>The console is a good place to send messages for debugging. We can enter code directly into the 
                console and because the browser is live, it will return values.  In the console try the following 
                code.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("Hello World");
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Let's unpack this line of code. </br>
                The console is an object in the browser and we have access to the properties and methods
                within the console. One of the methods is log. You can see all the properties and methods 
                for the console by just typing <span class="highlight">console.</span> and a drop down 
                list will appear with all the properties and methods. 
            </p>
            <p> log is a function, this means that it will run a piece of code in the background. It doesn't 
                matter what that code is, but we know that the code will send a message to the console screen.
            </p>
            <p>Functions have brackets. Within these brackets, we place an argument. This argument is the message 
                we will send to the console screen. <span class="highlight">console.log("Hello World");</span> 
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we use a semi-colon. Semi-Colons are necessary in many programming languages as this tells 
                the browser that this is the end of the statement.  </p>
            <p> Let's try some other console commands...</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("My Name Is ...");
console.warn("Warning, Warning");
console.error("Oh No! I'm Broken!");
console.clear();
alert("Boo!");
            </code></pre>
        </div>  

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Problems?</h2>
            <p>Working with code is great until something goes wrong. Let's take a look at a typical error message.
               Try this code:    
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("Hello";
            </code></pre>
            <p>Not closing the brackets will provide a syntax error : Invalid or Unexpected Token. The syntax is 
                the arangement of words and symbols that make up the code - This is the grammar that the code 
                understands. When something is wrong and the code does not understand, the error appears.  
                Invalid or Unexpected token meant that the code expected something (a close bracket) that wasn't there.
            </p>
            <p>When the browser can not understand the code, it will stop the program and report the error. We call these 
                <span class="highlight">exceptions</span>. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Quick Maths</h2>
            <p>Computers are essentially giant calculators and their main purpose is to perform mathematical 
                calculations. We can do that directly in the console log.    
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(5 + 5);
console.log(99.5 - 14.3);
console.log(190 / 13);
console.log(86 * 12);
console.log(5 ** 2);
console.log(153 % 5);
console.log(10++);
console.log(10--);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Try out these lines of code. What do you think each arithmetic operator perform?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Script.js</h2>
            <p>The console is great for testing out small snippets of code but it can only perform one operation 
                at a time. We, as coders, would like to run a sequence of operations, and for that we will need our
                own program file. Typically we call this script.js but you can call this whatever you want. The suffix
                .js tells the browser that this is a javascript file and it contains javascript code.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This project already has a script.js and it is linked at the end of the body tag. Have a look at 
                the HTML for this code.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>The script tag tells the browser that there is some JavaScript code and that it can be found 
                in the source file script.js. Note that this is not a self-closing tab - this is because you 
                could add javascript code within the open and close tags.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;script&gt;
    alert ("This code is running from inside the HTML page.");
&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>This is not considered good practice so we will ensure that all our JavaScript code is 
                placed in the correct script.js file. This file has some comments and comments which are 
                placed between /*...*/ are ignored by the browser - this means you can use these comment tags 
                to write your own commentary. You'll be encouraged to do this throughout the course. 
            </p>
            <p>Add the following code to your script.js file.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
/**
* JavaScript File.
* Your code can go here
*/

alert ("I am working from inside the script.js file");
console.log ("This is a log from inside the script.js file");
console.warn ("Notice the order of operations. JavaScript works from top to bottom.");
            </code></pre> 
            <p>If you can see your code working, you are now ready to become a JavaScript Coder.</p>

            <h2>Q&A and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <ul id="taskList">
                <li>✅ Watch out for capitalisation. Console.Log() is not the same as console.log()</li>
                <li>✅ Make sure that every open bracket ( is closed )</li>
                <li>✅ JavaScript will run without semi-colons, but these will become increasingly 
                    important - and it is good practice</li>
